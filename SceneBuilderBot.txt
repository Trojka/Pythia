What is it?
***********
This is what Microsoft says: (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/04/05/what-is-microsoft-bot-framework-overview/)

<qoute>
The Microsoft Bot Framework provides just what you need to build and connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services
</qoute>


What does it do?
***********
It basically is an abstraction above some popular messaging services, so that they can be used from a single codebase.




What does it NOT do?
***********
It does not provide language understanding or any parsing of the messages send to and by the bot.


Enkele losse onderwerpen:
=========================
opslaan van data (kan dit via de State API / Custom State API ?)
	via de State API	
		- context.UserData 					> data for user
		- context.ConversationData			> data for conversation
		- context.PrivateConversationData	> data for user in context of some conversation
	via Custom State API
		- wordt "gewoon" opgeslaan in een locale DocumentDb
afbeeldingen terugzenden / animated gifs (via rich cards?)
session management
